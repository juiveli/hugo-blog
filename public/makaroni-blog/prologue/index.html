  <h2>How it evolved</h2>
  <p>Clock: Roughly 18:00. My next housewarming party.</p>
<p>As always, I was slightly behind on cleaning, so I met my guests at the door on my way to take out the trash. They stopped me—told me to close my eyes.</p>
<p>I handed my keys to Tori and said, “It’s a blue one.” Confusion flickered across their faces, a hint of panic. Which blue? There were two blue keys. I left them to figure it out and continued with the trash.</p>
<p>When I returned, I stumbled upon some sort of ritual, their energy almost reverent. And then came the reveal—the makaroni.</p>
<p>A box that once held a LEGO Star Wars ship, now packed full of makaroni. “Seventy packages,” they declared. Twenty-eight kilograms.</p>
<p>I was baffled. Proud, somehow—but also dying inside. Because I wasn’t even done with the previous makaroni yet. When I moved, I still had ten packages left to transfer from my old apartment to the new one.</p>
<p>And now? Now, I had this massive pile of makaroni.</p>
<p>Days blurred together. Then, at some point—I don’t even remember when—I overheard a conversation. One of my friends (Tori or River, I think) said with a knowing tone:</p>
<p>“We will have to be cautious about where we find makaroni.”</p>
<p>And indeed—they must be cautious.</p>
<p>Because as long as this blog exists, somewhere, out there, makaroni waits. Waiting to be delivered. Waiting to deceive. Waiting to be forced upon them.</p>
<p>That is the word I give you all.</p>
