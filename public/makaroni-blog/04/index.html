  <h2 id="makaroni-payback">Makaroni Payback</h2>
<p>People had gathered at my place—the same pre-Christmas party as in one of my earlier stories. In the midst of the festivities, I embarked on a noble (and completely unserious) quest: selling makaroni. Let’s just say I wouldn’t have made it as a salesman, as my only successful transaction was convincing Brandon to buy two packages at a price of 0.10€ per package (for reference, I believe they cost around 0.40€ at the grocery store at the time). The catch? I was the one who paid.</p>
<p>The party continued, and when everyone left, the sacred makaroni remained untouched in my place. As any responsible (and slightly ridiculous) merchant would do, I transferred the money digitally to seal the deal, writing in the payment message: &ldquo;Do not worry, you will get your makaroni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan was simple—deliver the makaroni next time I saw Brandon. The reality? My excellent memory ensured I absolutely did not remember.</p>
<p>Then, my memory kicked back into gear. The perfect opportunity had arrived.</p>
<h2 id="the-barty-begins">The &lsquo;barty&rsquo; begins.</h2>
<p>Brandon and Stella had decided to host a &ldquo;barty&rdquo; (yes, with a &ldquo;b&rdquo;), aiming to bring together friends from different groups. Odd? Perhaps. Intriguing? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, we were instructed to make name tags, since not everyone knew each other. I asked River for help, and they, in their infinite wisdom, slapped my tag dead center on my chest—while I was wearing a hoodie. Not the most practical spot, as it landed right on the zipper. The name tag also required a personal trait. Mine? &ldquo;Electric,&rdquo; inspired by our group chat name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;mac-elektrik-hine-machinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemamachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachinemachin&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name was as long as the software allowed—so obviously, it had to be kept short.</p>
<p>Anyway, I repositioned the tag so the zipper wouldn’t be an obstacle, causing it to wrinkle. River, ever the comedian, remarked, &ldquo;It represents your personality better now.&rdquo; And boy, did I laugh. That moment reminded me how great a friend River is.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-party">Back to the party.</h2>
<p>I had brought buns (I love buns). We ate, we talked, and then—revelation. I had been fooled.</p>
<p>Brandon and Stella had gotten married. They now shared the same surname. Comprehending this new reality was a challenge.</p>
<p>We had a quiz (our team won!), played board games, and eventually, it was time for the sauna. Brandon was eager to go ASAP, and Shea volunteered to join them.</p>
<h2 id="now-for-the-makaroni-master-plan">Now, for the makaroni master plan.</h2>
<p>I entrusted not one, not two, but three sacred makaroni packages to one of my accomplices. I am no snitch, so I won’t reveal their identity. What I can say is that I needed them—after all, there were logistical challenges that made it impossible for me to carry out the makaroni placement myself. The logistical details aren&rsquo;t for the readers to know—just trust me.</p>
<p>When Brandon emerged from the sauna, they immediately accused me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn’t have been me, you know that!&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>But they knew. They always know. At this point, any makaroni-related incident is assumed to involve me.</p>
<p>In the end, I ensured they received the two packages I had technically sold to them. A bonus third package? That was just me being generous.</p>
<p>And not to brag, but if I had an accomplice, that means I’m not alone in this war. I don’t have enemies.</p>
<p>I have frenemies.</p>
<p>So, congratulations, Brandon and Stella!</p>
<p>Your wedding present will arrive a little later—just as expected from me.</p>
<h4 id="sincerely-juiveli">Sincerely, juiveli</h4>
