  <h2></h2>
  <h2 id="mail-man">Mail man</h2>
<p>We gathered at Shea with a single mission: to present PowerPoints. The topic? Anything. Literally, anything. Yet, as fate would have it, Neo and I failed in our quest to create our own. For this, I was handed a random PowerPoint—a collection of slides bound by destiny alone. I had no knowledge of its contents. Only after some time did I realize it was about conspiracies.</p>
<p>But before the actual gathering, I was on a crusade.</p>
<p>The sacred makaroni, an artifact of divine origins and unquestionable significance, had to be delivered. With deliberate ritual, I placed it in the mailbox. Then, in a move both mysterious and possibly unnecessary, I lingered for fifteen minutes after ringing the doorbell to the flat. Why? Even I do not fully know. At this point, it had become a habit.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, came the final stroke of destiny. Our group chat received an image—an undeniable, irrefutable sign that my mission had been completed. No secrecy this time. No denials. I admitted my work. The makaroni had found its way, and my story—however strange—was sealed in the archives of memory.</p>
<p>Perhaps the conspiracies were never in the PowerPoint, but rather in the makaroni itself.</p>
