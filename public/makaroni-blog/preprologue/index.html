  <h2>How it all began</h2>
  <p>I had a housewarming party after moving into an apartment inside a house that had been converted into multiple units. The guests arrived, bringing makaroni for me—lots of it. I gladly accepted.</p>
<p>But then, there were Legos.</p>
<p>Neo, ever the trickster, had cleverly disguised one of the makaroni packages. Instead of pasta, it contained Legos. And it wasn’t just Neo—Stella and Brandon had also contributed to the Lego chaos. I did the math—roughly 20 packages, each weighing 400 grams. That made 8 kilograms in total.</p>
<p>I blamed Shea. Why? Because Shea has a tendency to come up with ideas like this.</p>
<p>And so, an odd mix of wrath and amusement ignited something inside me. It was hilarious, but I truly believe—that was the day I clicked.</p>
