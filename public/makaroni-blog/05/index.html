<h3 id="plan">Plan:</h3>
<p>Whenever I visit my friends, they must witness the wrath of the sacred Makaroni. This time, we were visiting Brandon and Stella. At least one Makaroni package must mysteriously appear each time, as if by magic. I had made a list of possible hiding spots and had one particular location in mind. However, executing that hiding spot required a clever distraction. Since I had no accomplices at the time, I had to be discreet. When the moment arrived, I chose a not-so-great hiding spot instead.</p>
<p>(Side note: this crusade involved two sacred Makaroni packages, but the story of the second one will unravel later.)</p>
<p>The chosen hiding spot was in the hallway—under a summer hat. I would have never guessed that such a simple hiding spot could be so effective. Nearly four months later, on February 12th, 2025, a picture appeared in our group chat with the caption: &ldquo;How long has this been here???&rdquo;</p>
<p>I simply replied, &ldquo;Since October 20th, 2024.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hiding spot was finally uncovered, Brandon and I discussed it. Brandon mentioned that, at first, they thought the Makaroni package read &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo;. Well, it didn’t. It had a number—maybe 05/70—and was covered in transparent packaging tape. My storytelling seems a little out of order, as the reason for the tape will be told later. For now, let’s say it was meant to suppress the sacred power of Makaroni, ensuring it remained undetected.</p>
<p>All in all, I was proud of myself once again—proud of the sacred mission.</p>
